# pythonprogs
Pythonprogs is a repository that holds various small python programs that I have created for specific purposes. Nevertheless, they may be of some value to you if you want to use them for study purposes. 

You can use and alter them according to the GPL license.

## code_distiller.py

**code_distiller** is a program that takes a CSV file with three columns (code, item description, and storage unit) and creates a LaTeX output that can be used to typeset stickers with code128 codes and item description. 

## reader.py

**reader.py** is a simple script that parses the attached CSV file, which holds questions and answers in columns. It asks for a column number, calculates the sums of unique answers and draws a pie chart using the matplotlib library.

## russian.py

**russian.py** is a simple game simulating the Russian Roulette. Try your luck! You may not die this time.
